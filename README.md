# [Granceboarding](http://granceboarding.win/)
This originated as a really bad joke about an absurd fictional sport that involves a hoverboard powered by a dance pad where the hoverboard doubles as a grill. I decided that there was no better way to dedicate myself to the joke than by creating a webpage about this hot new thing called "Granceboarding".

The page itself is just a static HTML file that I styled with Sass. I used CSS Shake (http://elrumordelaluz.github.io/csshake/) for the shaking emphasis. The images of the hoverboard and grill are both licenced under the CC0 Creative Commons license from Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/en/hoverboard-e-board-wheels-exit-2003088/ and https://pixabay.com/en/grill-skewers-eating-frying-picnic-878001/ respectively). The image of the dance pad is licensed under the CC BY-SA 2.0, and the original source is (https://pixabay.com/en/grill-skewers-eating-frying-picnic-878001/). 

I am using Github Pages to host the site, since it's just a simple static page.
