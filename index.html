		<h1>Flip a move!</h1>
		<p>The Granceboard is all your dreams in one – as long as your dreams are RAD AS HELL! Grance all over the town, or race on a certified Grancetrack! But what exactly does it do?</p>
	</div>
		<div class="section" style="background-image: url('images/hoverboard.jpg')">
			<h1>RACE YOUR CARES AWAY</h1>
			<p>Zoom zoom down the track (or the sidewalk, or the hallway, or the moon! ANYTHING GOES!) on your Granceboard, at speeds of up to 35 mph (yeah, that’s right – 35 mph!!!). Granceboard uses innovative hoverboard technology to deliver the smoothest hoverboard experience on the market. Compact and lightweight, sleek and streamlined: it’s everything you’ve ever wanted in a hoverboard, but BETTER. Race your friends, or get serious and join your local Grance team! But that’s not all it does...</p>

			<h1>DANCE YOUR HEART OUT</h1>
			<p>Have you ever longed for an exciting, tactile dance arcade experience? Long no longer! Not only can you race the Granceboard at lightning speeds, you can dance while doing it! Hit all the beats on your favorite songs and zoom EVEN FASTER! Make your feet fly on the Granceboard’s 3x3 illuminated grid. Can you stay on? But what about when you’re done and need a snack after all that SICK AEROBIC EXERCISE? You won’t believe what else it can do…</p>

		<div class="section" style="background-image: url('images/grill.jpg')">
			<h1>GRILL SOME HOT MEAT</h1>
			<p>High five your friends and start up the exclusive Grancegrill! That’s right, with just the turn of a safety knob you can grill JUICY MEAT right on your Granceboard. Flip a steak or spin a kebab – if it can be grilled, the Granceboard has your back. Have a Grancegrill party right on the Grancetrack! Don’t worry, we won’t tell mom! So what are you waiting for? GET GRANCING!</p>
